With a mono cassette head in the panel and a NAB equalised ampli er circuit, Magnetophon is a cassette player without the transport mechanism. Try rubbing old cassette tapes on the panel, or attach a head on a wire to recreate Nam June Paikâ€™s
Random Access or Laurie Anderson's Tape Bow Violin.

BOM: 

- 2 x Thonkiconn Sockets 
- 1 x 50k Alpha Potentiometer (from Thonk, with bushing)  
- 1 x 10 pin 5x2 Euro power header 
- 1 x TL072 op amp 
- 1 x CTH1M MONO cassette playback head
- 2 x Poly Fuses (100ma blow or higher) 
- 2 x 1N4001 diodes 
- 1 x 47uf Electrolytic Capacitor 
- 2 x 10uf Electrolytic Capacitors 
- 2 x 100nf Ceramic Capacitor 
- 1 x 15nf Polybox Capacitor
- 1 x 200k resistor 
- 1 x 3.6k resistor 
- 2 x 2.2k resistor 
- 2 x 200R resistor 
- NB: C7 is NOT required but left on the board in case you have any oscillation in the first op amp. 

Status: 
- May 2016: Rev 1 (= Proto 2 with silkscreen tweaks) should be good to build. 
- Proto 2 works well. 
- Proto 2 designed and sent to fab 
- Proto 1 used for 4 days straight at SuperBooth 
- Proto 1 built, needed extra capactitor to kill huge ultrasonic oscillation
- Not verified 
- January 2016 Prototype sent for manufacture 
- October 2015 Designed 



Named after the [AEG Magnetophon](http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/tape.html), the first commercial tape recorder, revealed at the 1935 Radio Fair in Berlin.
